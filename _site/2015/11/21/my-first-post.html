<p>This is the Delorean.  See how it commands the space withen your web browser window?  Dont worry, thats just what it does.</p>
<p>You may be asking: Blogger whom I do not know, what seperates this heap of metal and bolts from any other ol' pile o junk lying around?</p>
<p>Luckily for you I just learned how to make lists in html!</p>
<h3>Reasons for awesomeness</h3></div>
<div class="content2">
<ol>
  <li>Impracticality: Any hip folk will let you know that for a thing to be cool, it needs to be unituitive, clunky,
  </br> and frustating to use (think: record players, corn cob pipes, tamagachi's).  This is exactly what the Delorean offers. </li>
  <li>Element of Danger: Is this car safe? No no it is not.  You might as well disengage the airbags, so that you meet
  </br>your demise earlier.  BUT is danger exciting? Absolutely.  Check-Mate.</li>
  <li>Time Travel: Ever wonder what it would be like to travel to distant exotic times? You dont need to wonder anymore!</br>
    it is a well known fact that these cars can traverse the time space continuom almost better than the streets</li>
