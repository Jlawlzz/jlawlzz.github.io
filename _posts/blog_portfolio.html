<h1> Grow a school : Lose a culture</h1>
</br>
</br>

  <p>
    One year ago I was the Program Coordinator for BDW, a masters program attached to the University of Colorado very similar </br>
  to the program I am at currently (Turing), save for the fact that it was focused on design rather than code. BDW was an </br>
  incredibly unique and awesome place, the class structure and teaching content was based around immersive learning rather </br>
  than the usual strict hours per semester model. Teachers were free to set class content how they saw fit depending on the landscape </br>
  of the industry at the time. Class could be rescheduled anytime as professors were both in industry and teaching, allowing for a </br>
  healthy and symbiotic relationship between Student and Teacher.  BDW put considerable resources into setting up day to week long </br>
  design sprints with industry, working with real companies such as Nike, Allstate, and Uber on real products.   <p>
</br>
</br>
  <p>
  If you are saying to yourself "This does not sound like a typical master's program", you are correct.  The only reason BDW was able </br>
  to exist as it did is because it physically and metaphorically removed itself from the university as much as it could.  One of my tasks </br>
  as program coordinator was working with the school to ensure everything we did was by the books for the school.  While we never went </br>
  outside our constraints as to regulation, it was a HUGE challenge working with the university to make our experimental program "legitimate".  <p>
</br>
</br>
  <p>
  University delegation did not used to be the struggle it is now for BDW. Throughout the seven years of its existence BDW has gained quite </br>
  some notoriety in the design/ad agency world. The result of this is a closer eye on the school in a very positive way.  The not so positive</br>
  side effect of this is that the university and governing bodies within colorado also had a closer eye on us.  No longer could the curriculum</br>
  simply be decided upon by what was best, but it had to be conceptualized and recorded in a way that made curriculum more sluggish.  Design</br>
  Sprints with industry became a battle of lawyers due to the university's insistence.  Community building events and discussions had to</br>
  be hush hush at times as the content would not be deemed 'appropriate' by the school (see Turing gear-up).  <p></br>
</br>
</br>
  <p>  This year BDW is taking a break to restructure the program to more strictly fit into the universities cookie cutter masters program out of</br>
  necessity.  No doubt it will still offer value to the students who attend, but it will be nothing compared to what it once was. Instead</br>
  of being a part of a community of people, the students will simply attend class and then head home.  Instead of engaging in incredible and</br>
  provocative conversation, students will follow a dialogue the university has approved.  The incredible positivity that BDW received from the</br>
  community, an initially great thing, caused regulation to destroy what was once great about it.  <p></br>
</br>
</br>
  This is my great fear about the future of Turing.</br>
