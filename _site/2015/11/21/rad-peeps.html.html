<div class="titles"><h2>This mid-<em>EVIL</em> duder just doin' his thing</div></h2>

<p>Quote from Artist: "A man simply known as Angstigwolf becomes the first person to
rock a mutha humpin' wolf t-shirt!

Look how flawlessly his totally beautiful, billowing hair and stylish be-tasseled cloak compliment the howling wolves upon his shirt. </br>
Angstigwolf is also the first dude to officially air guitar. However, some stupid lute player claimed that he was the first. </br>
The controversy was settled one evening at a pub. When the lute player confronted him, Angstigwolf was all like "Hell, no! You're air luting, fool!"</br>
Then Angstigwolf hopped on top of the bar and rocked the hell out! His fluffy hair swooshed around and his fingers mimicked a really hard to play solo. </br>
The crowd howled like the very wolves on Angstig's legendary shirt. In a moded daze, the lute player stumbled out of the pub to never be seen agian." </br>
